<h1>Final Web Site Proposal</h1>
<ol>
	<li>My website will entail video games. Particularly one by the name of "Dark Souls" that I will help new players of this game get started without spoiling the game itself. It will be constructed in a way that a user might go onto it and find information they need in a logical way that breaks the game down to simple terms.</li>
	<li>Targeted audience will be new players to the game (age range would vary)</li>
	<li>Browse the website and use it as a rescource to get started on the game without being overwhelmed</li>
	<li>Screen shots in-game including some of my own drawings possibly</li>
	<li>I wanted to specifically make a website about video games, but I felt focusing on them as a whole was too big of a scope so I decided to narrow it down to my favorite game.</li>
