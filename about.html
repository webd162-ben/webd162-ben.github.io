<h1>About me</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Hi, I'm Ben Ward! I'm 22 years old, hail from all over the states (was born in Saint Louis, MI but moved due to my mother's work a lot), and am aiming for a degree in Computer Science.</li>
	<li>I'm taking WEBD because I want to learn html, css, javascript, and whatever other languages come from making websites because I find it to be a useful skill to understand something we use every day of our lives (the web).</li>
	<li>The other classes I'm taking are a math class (trig) and a computer science class that involves excel and <em>eventually</em> visual basic.</li>
	<li>I'm a pretty big nerd, so one of my bigger hobbies has to be creating and running Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) campaigns/modules. I've come to accept over the years that this is actually one of my longest running hobbies. I can't really tell if that's a good or bad thing though!</li>
